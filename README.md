## Installation

Within a particular ecosystem, there may be a common way of installing things, such as using Yarn, NuGet, or Homebrew. However, consider the possibility that whoever is reading your README is a novice and would like more guidance. 

Listing specific steps helps remove ambiguity and gets people to using your project as quickly as possible. 

If it only runs in a specific context like a particular programming language version or operating system or has dependencies that have to be installed manually, also add a Requirements subsection.

Clone the repository down to your local drive by opening up a terminal in the folder of your choice and type the code: 

```bash
git clone https://github.com/KISMET-INC/garage_sally.git
```

Navigate into the main folder (which contains a package.json file) 
in the command prompt type the code:

```bash
npm init -y
````

Navigate into the client folder (which contains a package.json file) in the command prompt type the code:

```bash
npm init -y
````

Open the prototype branch in your IDE of choice.
